	      <b>My Undergraduate Research Experience at Waubonsee</b>
	    </font>
	    <p>Excitingly, I have had the opportunity to venture into research with my Anatomy Professor, <a herf="https://www.waubonsee.edu/vemu-dr-sheela" class="dark">Dr. Sheela Vemu</a> and four other students (Jennifer Sirkin, Brady Anderson, Chris Salgado, and Jatniel Morales). Our goal is to comprehend the immune escape of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 utilizing the Immune Epitope Database (<a href="https://www.iedb.org/home_v3.php" class="dark">IEDB</a>) to predict immune evasion. Our objective is to contribute to a more extensive understanding of COVID as a time-developing disease and support the development of vaccines. This research experience has allowed me to contribute to all aspects of the project, which includes optimizing the target antigens' position by developing python scripts, statistical interpretation of data, and creating educational materials(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=ZuxI_owk7po" class="dark">see an example</a>). As a result, our undergraduate research team has grown as the first-ever research opportunity in my community college, providing unique experiences to students, Chris Salgado and Jatniel Morales, who I am mentoring. I have also formulated an academic plan for undergraduate students to utilize the database.</p>
	    <p>In addition to my research experience, I have also worked as a <a href="https://www.waubonsee.edu/sanchez-rocha-joanna" class="dark">Paraprofessional Tutor</a>, responsible for providing support for the mastery of concepts and applications. I have helped students with effective study and learning strategies, reviewed class material, discussed problems, reviewed test questions, and worked on solutions to problems. As a tutor, I have excellent communication, presentation, and interpersonal skills, as well as the ability to effectively use technology to enhance tutoring sessions. I bring passion and enthusiasm to the Tutoring Centers and am collaborative with students, faculty, and colleagues.</p>
	    <p>Lastly, I was selected as one of the ten students nationwide from community colleges to participate in the internship program from the world-leading National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL) for Summer 2023. Through the NIIMBL immersion program, I will gain hands-on activities and direct interactions with industry professionals, offering real-world insight into biopharmaceutical industry careers. These experiences will contribute to my growth and development as a student and help me build a strong foundation for my future career in the field of biotechnology.</p>
